    { role: "user", content: "How would you make the case internally?" },
    { role: "persona", content: "I'd need data I can show the CFO. 'Competitor X is doing it' isn't enough. Give me: what's the reach to our ICP, what's the cost per thousand compared to our current channels, and what's a realistic timeline to see results. If it's 18 months before we know if it's working, that's a harder sell." },

If everyone else in our space is doing boring whitepapers and we're doing something human, maybe that stands out. I'd want to test it small before committing real budget." },
