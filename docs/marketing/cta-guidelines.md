# CTA Thinking - 2026-02-09

## Key Insight: CTAs Should Match Their Destination

A CTA should be **clear about what happens when you click it**, not just aspirational or vague.

## Current State

**Hero CTA links to:** `#pricing` (scrolls to payment section)

**What it should say:**

- ✅ "Choose your plan"
- ✅ "See pricing"
- ✅ "Book your 3 personas"
- ✅ "Get your personas"

**What it shouldn't say:**

- ❌ "Talk to your customers" (that happens AFTER purchase, misleading)
- ❌ "Try it now" (implies free trial, but we're going straight to payment)
- ❌ "Get started" (too vague, doesn't indicate it's a purchase)

## Why "Book Your 3 Personas" Works

1. **Accurate:** Starter tier gives you 3 personas
2. **Clear action:** "Book" implies a transaction/purchase
3. **Concrete:** You know exactly what you're getting
4. **Sets expectations:** Not hiding that this is a paid product

## Future State (When Hero Demo Exists)

**Hero will have two parts:**

### 1. Interactive Demo (above the fold)

- User can actually talk to a persona right there
- CTA within demo: "Ask Maya" or "Send a message"
- This is the "try it" moment

### 2. Purchase CTA (below demo)

- After they've tried the demo
- CTA: "Book your 3 personas" or "Get full access"
- Links to pricing/payment
- Clear that this is purchasing

## General CTA Principles

### Match the action to the destination

- **Links to pricing/payment?** → Make it clear it's a purchase ("Book," "Choose plan," "See pricing")
- **Links to demo?** → Make it clear it's a trial ("Try it," "Ask Maya," "Test it out")
- **Links to signup?** → Make it clear it's registration ("Sign up," "Create account")
- **Links to waitlist?** → Make it clear it's waiting ("Join waitlist," "Get notified")

### Don't oversell

- If clicking doesn't let them talk to customers yet, don't say "Talk to your customers"
- If there's no free trial, don't say "Try it free"
- If setup is required, don't say "Get instant feedback"

### Be specific over generic

- ❌ "Get started" (generic, unclear)
- ✅ "Book your 3 personas" (specific, clear)

## Current Recommendations

**Hero CTA:** "Choose your plan" or "See pricing"

- Accurate: It scrolls to pricing
- Clear: You know you're going to see payment options
- Not overselling: Doesn't promise something that's not there yet

**Nav CTA:** "Get started" is fine here (navbar CTAs can be more generic)

**Pricing CTAs:**

- Starter: "Get 3 personas" or "Start with 3"
- Team: "Get full roster" or "Get 50+ personas"

## When to Update

Once the hero demo is live (Issue #3), then:

- Demo CTA: "Ask Maya a question" (interaction)
- Post-demo CTA: "Book your personas" (purchase)

Until then, keep it simple and honest about where the link goes.
