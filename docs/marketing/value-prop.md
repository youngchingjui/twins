# Value Proposition

**Last updated:** 2026-02-09

## The Core Insight

These aren't generic ChatGPT responses with persona prompts slapped on top. These are **highly curated, battle-tested personas** that respond with distinct perspectives matching real population segments.

---

## What Makes This Different

### What we're NOT

- ❌ Generic AI with a persona description
- ❌ ChatGPT that you have to prompt-engineer yourself
- ❌ Inconsistent responses that feel robotic
- ❌ DIY persona building that takes weeks to get right

### What we ARE

- ✅ **Pre-built, proven personas** - already tested and refined
- ✅ **Distinct perspectives** - each one thinks and responds differently (not just different words, different viewpoints)
- ✅ **Rich internal context** - they don't just have a job title, they have motivations, constraints, team dynamics, and personal circumstances that shape their responses
- ✅ **Behaviorally accurate** - they respond like real people in that segment actually would, because they're thinking from within realistic life circumstances
- ✅ **Ready to use** - no setup, no prompt crafting, no testing phase
- ✅ **Curated roster** - we've done the hard work of building realistic, useful personas

## The Work We've Already Done For You

### 1. Deep Persona Development

Not just demographics, but rich internal context:

- Personal motivations (e.g., up for promotion, building credibility)
- Organizational dynamics (boss, reports, stakeholders)
- Constraints and pressures (budget, timeline, politics)
- Past experiences that shape their worldview

### 2. Testing & Refinement

Iterated until responses feel authentic, not robotic:

- Real people respond from within their life context, not in a vacuum
- Each persona has specific circumstances that influence their perspective

### 3. Calibration

These personas vote with their dollars/responses like real people would:

- Not just what they say, but how they think through decisions

### 4. Consistency

Each persona maintains their perspective across conversations:

- Same motivations, same constraints, same thought patterns

## The Depth That Makes It Real

### Why Generic ChatGPT Prompts Don't Work

**Example prompt:** "Act like a product manager and review this deck"

- ❌ Generic, surface-level feedback
- ❌ No context about their specific situation
- ❌ Inconsistent voice and perspective
- ❌ Feels like AI trying to roleplay

### Why Our Personas Are Different

**Maya isn't a prompt - she's a fully realized person:**

- She works at a specific type of company (large enterprise SaaS)
- She manages 3 reports with different skill levels
- Her boss values strategic thinking and low-risk execution
- She's up for promotion in July, so she's thinking about visibility
- She's navigated failed product launches before and learned from them
- She has political capital to spend and needs to choose battles wisely

When Maya reviews your deck, she's not just giving "PM feedback" - she's responding from within this rich context. That's what makes it feel real and useful.

---

## Concrete Use Cases

### Example 1: PPT Feedback

**Scenario:** You have a pitch deck for a new SaaS product

**Action:** Email it to Maya (product manager at a large org, managing 3 reports, up for promotion in July)

**Response:** "The problem slide is compelling, but I don't see enough about your competitive moat. Why wouldn't I just use Notion for this? Also, if I bring this to my VP, they're going to ask about ROI and implementation timeline - you should add a slide on that."

**Why it's useful:** Her response is shaped by her context - she needs to look strategic to her boss, she's thinking about stakeholder buy-in, she's risk-aware because promotion is coming up.

### Example 2: Marketing Campaign Testing

**Scenario:** You're launching a new pricing page

**Action:** Share it with Alex (tech-skeptical small business owner)

**Response:** "This feels expensive for what I'm getting. Can I try it for free first? What happens if I need to cancel?"

**Why it's useful:** Real skeptical buyer objections you need to address.

### Example 3: Product Validation

**Scenario:** You're considering a new feature

**Action:** Ask Sarah (budget-conscious startup founder)

**Response:** "Honestly, I wouldn't pay extra for this. What I really need is better Slack integration."

**Why it's useful:** Real talk about priorities and willingness to pay.

## Why This Matters

You're not testing your idea on:

- Generic AI that agrees with everything
- Colleagues who are too close to the problem
- Expensive focus groups that take weeks to schedule

You're getting **instant feedback from perspectives that match your actual target customers** - including their motivations, constraints, and real-world context - without the cost, time, or brand risk of real user research.

---

## Messaging Framework

### Headline Concept

"Stop imagining what your customers think. Ask them."

### Subhead Concept

"Pre-built customer personas that respond like real people - not like ChatGPT. No prompt engineering. No setup. Just real feedback from real perspectives."

### Key Message

We've done the hard work of building, testing, and refining these personas so they respond like real population segments - complete with the motivations, constraints, and context that shape real decisions. You just pick the ones that match your target audience and start asking questions.

### Proof Points to Emphasize

- "Each persona has rich internal context - not just demographics"
- "They respond from within realistic life circumstances"
- "You're getting feedback shaped by actual constraints and motivations"
- "Pre-built and battle-tested - no prompt engineering required"

## How to Communicate the Depth

### Don't Overwhelm with Details Upfront

Hint at the depth without listing everything:

- ❌ "Maya is a PM at a large enterprise SaaS company who manages 3 reports and is up for promotion in July..."
- ✅ "Meet Maya, a product manager navigating the realities of a large org - stakeholder politics, risk management, and career pressures included."

### Show, Don't Tell

Let people discover the depth through the demo:

- In the hero demo, show Maya's response revealing her context naturally
- Example: "I like the concept, but I'd need to see stronger ROI metrics before I could get my VP on board. Last quarter we got burned on a tool that promised similar benefits..."

### The Depth Is the Moat

- This is what makes it hard to replicate
- You can't just prompt ChatGPT to get this level of realistic nuance
- The curation, testing, and context-building is the real work

---

## Better Terminology

Instead of "voice" (feels too abstract/marketing-y), use:

- **Perspective** - "get feedback from 3 different perspectives" (formal)
- **Take** - "see Maya's take on your deck" (casual, modern)
- **Point of view** - "each persona brings a distinct POV"
- **Lens** - "view your campaign through different lenses"

**Recommendation:** Use **"perspective"** for formal copy, **"take"** for casual/conversational copy.
