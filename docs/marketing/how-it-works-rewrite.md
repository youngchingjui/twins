# How It Works - Rewrite Notes

Related to: **Issue #2 - Rework "How It Works" section**

## Current Problem

The current "How It Works" section **completely contradicts the value proposition**. It tells users they need to:

1. ❌ Define the identity
2. ❌ Build the backstory
3. ❌ Layer in values and patterns
4. ❌ Set contextual states
5. ✅ Start the conversation (only step 5 is correct!)
6. ✅ Iterate without cost (step 6 is correct)

**This is backwards!** The entire value prop is: "We've already done steps 1-4 for you."

## What It Should Say

The actual user journey is:

1. ✅ **Browse the roster** - See the personas we've already built
2. ✅ **Pick your perspectives** - Choose 3 (Starter) or 50+ (Team) personas
3. ✅ **Connect to your channels** - Add them to Slack, Email, etc.
4. ✅ **Start asking questions** - Get immediate feedback
5. ✅ **Iterate freely** - Ask follow-ups, test variations, try different personas

## Key Messaging Shift

### OLD (current, wrong)

- Implies user has to do complex setup work
- Makes it feel like weeks of configuration
- Contradicts "pre-built, ready to use" value prop
- Adds friction and perceived effort

### NEW (correct)

- Emphasizes personas are already built
- Shows how simple it is to start using
- Reinforces "we've done the hard work" message
- Removes friction, shows speed

## Recommended New Steps

### 1. Browse the roster

"See our curated collection of pre-built customer personas - each one researched, tested, and refined to match real population segments."

### 2. Pick your perspectives

"Choose the personas that match your target audience. Starter gives you 3, Team gives you 50+. No setup, no configuration needed."

### 3. Connect your channels

"Add personas to Slack, Email, or wherever you work. They're available 24/7, respond in seconds."

### 4. Start asking questions

"Show them your deck. Test your messaging. Validate your ideas. Get real feedback from realistic perspectives - instantly."

### 5. Iterate without limits

"Ask follow-ups. Try different approaches. Test on multiple personas. The personas never get tired, never need scheduling, never cost extra."

## What About Custom Personas?

Custom persona creation should be:

- Mentioned as a **Team/Enterprise feature** (not the default path)
- Positioned as "advanced" or "optional"
- De-emphasized compared to using the pre-built roster

Something like:

> "Need a highly specific persona? Team and Enterprise customers can request custom personas tailored to your exact audience."

## Implementation

This rewrite is tracked in **Issue #2**. The section needs to be completely rewritten to match the actual product flow and value proposition.

- Issue #8: 3-way comparison (should emphasize pre-built vs DIY)
