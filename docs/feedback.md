**2026-02-08** - The landing page doesn't immediately prove the concept. Visitor reaction is "oh you say you have real customers that can give feedback... show me." Need to demonstrate value instantly, not just describe it.

**2026-02-08** - The "cis-" references in persona content feel too political / on the nose. Remove them — personas should feel natural without signaling.

**2026-02-08** - The "How it works" section feels outdated. It frames the product as "build your own customer" which is wrong — the value is that we *already have* a roster of customers ready to go. The user's job is just to connect them to where they work (Slack, email, etc.), not to create personas from scratch. The current framing adds friction and undersells the magic.

**2026-02-08** - Channels (Slack, email, etc.) deserve their own deeper pages, not just a brief mention on the landing page. Good for SEO and for users who want to understand a specific integration in depth.

**2026-02-08** - Priority is speed. Get something live and in front of real users fast to test reactions. Don't over-build before validating. Marketing should be scrappy — blog posts, social media, zero/low cost.

**2026-02-08** - The comparison section is missing a huge part of the picture. We're not just competing against static personas — we're also competing against *real people* (focus groups, user interviews, etc.). Real people are the gold standard but come with real costs: expensive, slow, brand risk, small samples, social desirability bias. The comparison should make clear that digital twins give you most of the benefit of real people without the downsides.

**2026-02-08** - Before writing marketing content or blog posts, we need to actually create at least 1 digital customer and interact with them to get a real feel for how they behave. Authentic experience first — then we can write about it credibly.
