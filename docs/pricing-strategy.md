# Pricing Strategy

## Current Status

**Status:** Early stage / pre-launch. Pricing is intentionally simple to get live quickly and gather real customer feedback.

## Current Pricing (as of 2026-02-09)

| Tier | Price | Target Audience |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Starter** | $50/month | Individuals, solopreneurs, small teams testing the concept |
| **Team** | $300/month | Product teams, marketing teams, growing companies |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Large organizations, custom requirements |

## Pricing Philosophy

**Speed over perfection:** The goal right now is to get something live and start learning from real customers. These prices are intentionally simple round numbers to reduce decision fatigue (both for us and customers).

**Validate before optimizing:** We need to understand:
- Who actually wants this product?
- What value do they get from it?
- How do they use it?
- What are they willing to pay?

Once we have 10-20 paying customers, we'll have real data to inform pricing decisions.

## What's Included (Revised - Persona Access Model)

**Key change:** Instead of limiting by conversations (confusing, unpredictable), limit by number of personas you can access. Much simpler and clearer value.

### Starter - $50/month
*For testing the waters*

- **Access to 3 curated personas**
- **Unlimited conversations** with those 3
- Pick from our roster (or we recommend based on your industry)
- Connect to Slack + Email
- Export conversation logs
- Community support

### Team - $300/month
*For product and marketing teams*

- **Access to 50+ curated personas**
- Full roster access
- **Unlimited conversations**
- Team collaboration (5 seats)
- Request custom persona development
- Priority support
- API access

### Enterprise - Custom pricing
*For organizations at scale*

- **Unlimited persona access**
- Everything in Team
- Unlimited seats
- Custom persona development (we build them for you)
- Dedicated account manager
- SSO & advanced security
- Custom integrations
- SLA guarantees

## Why Persona Access (Not Conversation Limits)

**Rejected approach:** Limit by conversations per month
- ❌ Confusing - "What counts as a conversation? How long is one?"
- ❌ Unpredictable - "Will I run out mid-month?"
- ❌ Creates anxiety - Users ration usage instead of using freely

**Better approach:** Limit by number of personas accessible
- ✅ Crystal clear - "I get 3 perspectives vs 50 perspectives"
- ✅ Predictable - "I can talk to them as much as I need"
- ✅ Scales with value - More personas = more diverse perspectives

## Open Questions

- **Persona selection:** Starter gets 3 - do they pick any 3, or from a recommended subset?
- **Custom persona creation:** Team tier only (keep Starter simple)? Or offer as add-on?
- **Seat pricing:** Keep it simple with fixed 5 seats on Team, or charge per additional seat?
- **Annual discounts:** Offer 2 months free for annual commitment? (Helps cash flow and retention)
- **Free tier vs trial:** 7-day free trial with full access? Or freemium with 1 persona forever?
- **Persona switching:** Can Starter users change which 3 personas they have access to? (Recommend yes, maybe monthly)

## Competitive Landscape

Need to research:
- What do user research tools charge? (UserTesting, User Interviews, etc.)
- What do AI/chatbot platforms charge? (for structural comparison)
- What do market research platforms charge? (Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey, etc.)

## Next Steps

1. Launch with $50 Starter / $300 Team
2. Get 10-20 paying customers
3. Conduct pricing interviews to understand perceived value
4. Analyze usage patterns (which features matter most?)
5. Iterate based on data
